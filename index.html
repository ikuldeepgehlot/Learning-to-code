    <small>A breif explaination on all the things I have been learning using my own words.</small>
    <H1>What is Git and Github?</H1>
    <p>Git is something that is stored in the local computer. Github is something that is stored on cloud.</p>
    <p>For example Photo Gallery on phone is Git and Google Photos app is Github.</p>
    <p>Photo Gallery is saved on local storage inside the phone and cannot be retirved in case you lose your phone whereas Google photos app is always saved on the cloud and hence it is more reliable because we can access the same on any device and hence Git & Github works like this.</p>

    <h1>What is Branch and why do we need to create branch in Github?</h1>
    <p>Suppose you are driving a car on a main road national highway and after sometimes you realise you need to fill the petrol. So you take a diversion where you found the petrol pump and after you have filled it you move to main road national highway.</p>
    <p>You created your own branch, you did some changes and reverted back to main.</p>

    <h1>Top Git commands</h1>
    <p>Below are the list of basic git commands - </p>
    <ul>
        <li>docs: When you have updated the docs.</li>
        <li>fix: if you have done some fixing for example the output was giving some other results and hence rectified it.</li>
        <li>style: if you have applied some make up to the code like using CHALK library etc.</li>
        <li>feat: you added some features.</li>
        <li>refractor: variable renaming.</li>
        <li>chore: Updatin build task, package update etc.</li>
        <li>test: if you have done some testing.</li>
    </ul>
