    <small>A breif explaination on all the things I have been learning using my own words.</small>
    <H1>What is Git and Github?</H1>
    <p>Git is something that is stored in the local computer. Github is something that is stored on cloud.</p>
    <p>For example Photo Gallery on phone is Git and Google Photos app is Github.</p>
    <p>Photo Gallery is saved on local storage inside the phone and cannot be retirved in case you lose your phone whereas Google photos app is always saved on the cloud and hence it is more reliable because we can access the same on any device and hence Git & Github works like this.</p>
